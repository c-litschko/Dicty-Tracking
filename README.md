# Dicty-Tracking
Dicty Tracking is a free, fast and easy-to-use, standalone tool for semi-automatic tracking of migrating Dictyostelium cells from phase-contrast time-lapse image series based on MATLAB®. The tool requires [Fiji/ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Fiji) and the installation of [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).
