### About

Dicty Tracking is a free, fast and easy-to-use standalone tool for semi-automatic tracking of migrating Dictyostelium cells from phase-contrast time-lapse image series based on MATLAB®. It requires [Fiji/ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Fiji) and the installation of [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).

The tool and/or associated files were used in the following works:
* Litschko C, Brühmann S, Csiszár A, Stephan T, Dimchev V, Damiano-Guercio J, Junemann A, Körber S, Winterhoff M, Nordholz B, Ramalingam N, Peckham M, Rottner K, Merkel R, Faix J. (2019) Functional integrity of the contractile actin cortex is safeguarded by multiple Diaphanous-related formins. *Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A* 116(9):3594-3603. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821638116
* Litschko C, Linkner J, Brühmann S, Stradal TEB, Reinl T, Jänsch L, Rottner K, Faix J. (2017) Differential functions of WAVE regulatory complex subunits in the regulation of actin-driven processes. *Eur J Cell Biol.* 96(8):715-727. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2017.08.003

The tool and it's associated files are licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE). The complete fileset is publically available on **[figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Dicty_Tracking_A_standalone_tool_for_fast_and_easy_tracking_of_migrating_Dictyostelium_cells/5024552)** and can be cited as
